    <h4>Project Outcomes</h4>
    <p>Discussed in team pages.</p>
    <br />
    <h4>Community Research on Changes in Attitudes and Levels of Pride</h4>
    <p>Each year we conduct one on one research with a minimum of 210 South Invercargill residents to determine their level of pride in how South Invercargill looks and feels.</p>
    <p>Our latest research shows that we have made substantial progress in changing the community’s view of South Invercargill. The percentage who agree, or strongly agree, with the statement, “I feel a sense of pride in how South Invercargill looks and feels” has risen from 35% in 2012 to 82.5% in 2015. Results are shown in the graphs below:</p>

    <h4>Views of South Alive performance</h4>
    <p>Our annual research also measures awareness of South Alive and views about our effectiveness. The results are shown below. In summary, the 2015 results showed that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>12.1% think we’re making, ‘a reasonable amount of difference for the time we’ve been in place’</li>
        <li>36.4% think we’re making ‘quite a bit of difference’</li>
        <li>42.8% think we’re making ‘a big difference’</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The total, in 2015, of all those who think we’re making some degree of positive difference is 91.3%.</strong></p>
